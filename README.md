Loan default prediction with LightGBM and XGBoost

Loan default prediction is one of the
critical problem faced by the financial institutions
such as banks, loan providers etc. and has significant
impact on their profit.Although many traditional
methods exist for mining information about a
loan application, most of these methods seem to be
under performing as there have been reported increases
in the number of bad loans. In this article,
I use Light Gradient Boosting Machine(LightGBM)
and eXtreme Gradient Boosting(XG-Boost) algorithms
to predict loan default. The prediction is
based on historical data from Small Business Administration
(SBA), a US government body which
provides loan supports to entrepreneurs and small
businesses. The data consists of historical information
of loan applications over certain period of time.
In the article important statistical evaluation metrics
such as Accuracy, Recall, precision, F1-Score and
ROC area of the analysis are presented. This article
provides an effective basis for loan credit approval
in order to identify risky stakeholders from a
large number of loan applications using predictive
modelling using the algorithms.
